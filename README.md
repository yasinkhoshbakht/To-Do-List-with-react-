_To-Do List App_

This is a simple To-Do List application built with React. The app allows users to add, delete, and mark tasks as completed. The tasks are also saved to localStorage, so they persist even after refreshing the page.

Features:

Add New Tasks: You can add new tasks to your to-do list by typing in the input box and clicking the "Add" button.
Mark Tasks as Completed: Click on a task to mark it as completed. Completed tasks will be crossed out.
Delete Tasks: Click the "Delete" button next to a task to remove it from the list.
Persistent Storage: Your tasks are saved in the browser's localStorage, so they will remain even if you close or refresh the page.
